# Turbolinks Challenge Reflection

I really liked the asset pipeline poem; it was a clear example of using the asset pipeline to organize and use multiple Javascript or CSS files with rails. I was unable to use the combination of an attribute tag with a specific ID (eg. body#color) to apply the Jquery CSS styling but I was able to use the url path to change the color. I want to continue working with the attribute and class/ID selectors to nest styling rules and make page specific styles.
